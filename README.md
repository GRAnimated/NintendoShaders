# NintendoShaders

NintendoShaders is a collection of GLSL shaders created by Nintendo that have been used within their games. The primary goal of this project is to categorize and merge updates within these shaders, and eventually compile and reimplement them.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive repository of GLSL shaders found in Nintendo games, specifically those from the Wii U and Switch platforms. The shaders are extracted directly from the games, utilizing the direct shader source provided by Nintendo. The intention is to make these shaders more accessible, cleaner, and usable for better research.

## Sources

#### Super Mario Odyssey
* Located under `al/RedStar`
* `.meta` files list files that exist in each of the game's `.sharc` files
* Shaders folder has every shader in one folder

## Legality

This project has the same intent as a site like Models Resource, where models are ripped from games and published in cleaner formats. Any attempts to PR content from the SDKs will be ignored. Everything here has been sourced from games.
